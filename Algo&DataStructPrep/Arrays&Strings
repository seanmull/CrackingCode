Some basic concepts
Strings - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)
- String are often implemented as a array of characters(char). 
- The char can be usually encoded as ASCII(256) or UNICODE.
- They are immutable in Java.  Which mean they cannot be changed.
- Instant access to individual elements is allowed.
- String builder can used to append strings by using a resizeable array
   
Arrays
- Stored in a contiguous chunk of memory.
- Normal arrays are set in size.  In other words they are static.
- Can be made of many data types int, char, string etc. 

Strengths
-Simple data structures.  Can build almost anything with it.
-Allows instant 0(1) time for lookup.

Weaknesses
-Strings are immutable which means each time you append you have to copy. Which is 0(n^2) time.
-Arrays are of fixed size.
-Filling an array is O(n) time.

How to implement Arrays and Strings in Java

Strings

//For making a simple string
String s = "abc";

//To make a char array
char[] charArray = s.toCharArray();

//To index a string
s[0] -> 'a' //note '' means char "" means string

//Stringbuilder


Arrays

//To build a 1-D array

//To build a 2-D array

//Typical type implementations
