		/*You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

		You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a 
		different day in the future to sell that stock.

		Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

		 

		Example 1:

		Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
		Output: 5
		Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
		Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
		Example 2:

		Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
		Output: 0
		Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
		 

		Constraints:

		1 <= prices.length <= 105
		0 <= prices[i] <= 104*/
