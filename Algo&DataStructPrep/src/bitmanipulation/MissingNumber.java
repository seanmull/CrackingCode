		/*Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the 
		 *only number in the range that is missing from the array.

		Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

		Example 1:

		Input: nums = [3,0,1]
		Output: 2
		Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
		
		Example 2:

		Input: nums = [0,1]
		Output: 2
		Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
				
		Example 3:

		Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
		Output: 8
		Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
				
		Example 4:

		Input: nums = [0]
		Output: 1
		Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
				 
		Constraints:

		n == nums.length
		1 <= n <= 10^4
		0 <= nums[i] <= n
		All the numbers of nums are unique.*/
		
		//One solution
		int[] inputArray = new int[] {9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1};
		//Create a 1-n array with constant space
		int n = 10000;
		int[] orderedArray = new int[n+1];
		boolean isFound;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < n+1; i++) orderedArray[i] = i;
		//Create a loop that iterates this new array
		for(int i = 0; i < n+1; i++) {
			isFound = false;
			for(int j = 0; j < inputArray.length; j++) {
				if(orderedArray[i] == inputArray[j]) isFound = true;
			}
			if(!isFound) {
				System.out.println("The missing number in Array : " + Arrays.toString(inputArray) + " is " + orderedArray[i]);
				System.exit(0);
			}
		}
		//The first loop is constant space and runtime since it only goes to 10000
		//The second loop only goes through n numbers
		//So space is O(1) and runtime is 1 * n which is O(n)
