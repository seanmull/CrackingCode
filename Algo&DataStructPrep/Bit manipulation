Some basic concepts

8 bits per byte
int is 4 bytes => 32 bits => between +2 - 2 million

Converting binary to decimal is as follows:
1010, since 1(2⁰) + 0(2¹) + 1(2²) + 0(2³) = 10
So in decimal we go from 0-9 (10 options) while in binary we have 0-1 (2 options)

Operations 
	
	(check using this https://onlinetoolz.net/bitshift)
	Negation ~x
	0101 -> 1010 (we flip the 0 and 1)
	
	Left shift  x << (n) where n is a number (<<< is the logical shift variant where the sign is shifted too)
	101010 -> 1010100 (shift all numbers left) (n = 1)
	Note: Left most position is ignored
	
	Right shift  x >> (n) where n is a number
	101010 -> 10101 (shift all numbers right) (n = 1) arithmetic shift
	
	1 & 1 = 1
	0 & 0 = 0
	1 & 0 = 0
	0 & 1 = 0
	
	1 | 1 = 1
	0 | 0 = 0
	1 | 0 = 1
	0 | 1 = 1
	
	1 ^ 1 = 0
	0 ^ 0 = 0
	0 ^ 1 = 1
	1 ^ 0 = 1
	
	& (and)
	1100 & 1011 = 1000 (since only first digit is in both)
	
	101 & 001 = 001
	
	| (or)
	1100 & 1011 = 1111 (since all digits have at least on in each)
	
	^ (xor)
	1100 & 1011 = 0111 (since the first digit is in both)
	
	1100 & 1100 = 
	
	(https://www.calculator.net/binary-calculator.html)
	Add
	20 + 10 = 30
	10100 + 1010 = 11110
	
	Subtract
	20 - 10 = 10
	10100 - 1010 = 1010
	
	Multiply
	20 * 10 = 200
	10100 * 1010 = 11001000
	
	Divide
	20 / 10 = 2
	10100 / 1010 = 10
	
	Getting bits
	And operation clears all bits except the shifted 1
	If its zero it will return false
	num & (1 << i) != 0
	
	Setting bits
	All the other zeros will not effect num but the 1
	num | (1 << i)
	
	Clearing bit
	Same as getting bit but in reverse
	All the 1s will just mirror num
	The one 0 will clear the bit
	num & ~(1 << i);
	
	Updating bit
	value = bitIs1 ? 1 : 0;
	mask = ~(1 << i)
	return (num & mask) | (value << i)
	
	Signed vs Unsigned
	First place in memory for binary is reserved for negative sign if signed
	For Unsigned this place is used to store a bigger number if needed.

How to use bitwise operation in java

Add a&b
Or a|b
Xor a^b
Compliment ~a

You can also do the shorthand
a = a & b => a &= b

a = 10
a>>1 = 5 (signed shift)

a = -10
a>>>1 = 2147483643 (unsigned shift)

//To represent binary version of int
int n = 7;
String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
assertEquals("111", binaryString);
